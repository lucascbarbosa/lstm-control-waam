This work presents a Neural Network application capable of estimating in real time the geometric characteristics (width and height) of simple strands manufactured through Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM).

The area of Additive Manufacturing (AM) has become increasingly studied and developed in the context of Industry 4.0 due to its ability to produce parts with complex geometries, reduced material use, and superior mechanical properties (the so-called metamaterials).

However, in the context of WAAM, the physical dynamics of the process are still little known, due to the high complexity of modeling, causing the parts to lack conformation and geometric uniformity. To work around this problem, approximate models are used that do not necessarily have a good performance-complexity ratio.

As a result, some studies use Deep Learning (DL) models, the so-called Neural Networks (RN), to estimate the geometric characteristics of the bead (height and width) based on welding parameters (such as current, voltage and wire feed speed). The architecture used was Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, which was coupled to a closed control loop working as a controller.
